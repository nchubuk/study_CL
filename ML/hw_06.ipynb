In relation to \\\"substantive unfairness\\\", the applicants cite R v Inland Revenue Commissioner; Ex parte Preston [1984] UKHL 5 ; [1985] AC 835 at 866 7 (Templeman LJ) (for the principle that judicial review may be warranted where a commissioner's decision is unfair and amounting to a breach of contract or breach of representation, and therefore within the ambit of an abuse of power). They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity.

In relation to \\\"substantive unfairness\\\", the applicants cite R v Inland Revenue Commissioner; Ex parte Preston [1984] UKHL 5 ; [1985] AC 835 at 866 7 (Templeman LJ) (for the principle that judicial review may be warranted where a commissioner's decision is unfair and amounting to a breach of contract or breach of representation, and therefore within the ambit of an abuse of power). They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity. The Tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 July 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [Word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_in_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data[data['title_in_text'] == 0]['case_outcome'].unique()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4KDEt2mYt7Se","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745155746206,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Наталия Федорова","userId":"07542168442705069017"}},"outputId":"2accbce3-7b75-45bf-8e9c-47688e06a02a"},"id":"4KDEt2mYt7Se","execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array(['cited', 'followed', 'related', 'referred to', 'considered',\n","       'distinguished', 'applied', 'discussed', 'affirmed', 'approved'],\n","      dtype=object)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data[data['title_in_text'] == 1]['case_outcome'].unique()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"LXPgp8fcvSZl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745155748152,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Наталия Федорова","userId":"07542168442705069017"}},"outputId":"c25277ef-65c4-4ffb-9e84-8711adc97009"},"id":"LXPgp8fcvSZl","execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array(['cited', 'applied', 'followed', 'referred to', 'related',\n","       'considered', 'discussed', 'distinguished', 'affirmed', 'approved'],\n","      dtype=object)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data[data['title_in_text'] == 0].loc[3].case_title"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"sAlHlWCBY77X","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745155779458,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":108,"user":{"displayName":"Наталия Федорова","userId":"07542168442705069017"}},"outputId":"b9012691-2afa-4932-fbfa-caa7063fa0f6"},"id":"sAlHlWCBY77X","execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullett Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data[data['title_in_text'] == 0].loc[3].case_text # цитирование есть, но не полное совпадение из-за опечатки"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":157},"id":"TbjjCXIIvnnW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745155752713,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":125,"user":{"displayName":"Наталия Федорова","userId":"07542168442705069017"}},"outputId":"72b239a8-8bd6-4af0-d6fd-e3c705cbac09"},"id":"TbjjCXIIvnnW","execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'The general principles governing the exercise of the discretion to award indemnity costs after rejection by an unsuccessful party of a so called Calderbank letter were set out in the judgment of the Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386. In summary those principles are: 1. Mere refusal of a \"Calderbank offer\" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs. In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]): if the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle. 2. To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable. 3. The reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree is to be viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Обучение классификационной модели"],"metadata":{"id":"rgW1L_i51y67"},"id":"rgW1L_i51y67"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","from rapidfuzz import fuzz\n","nltk.download('punkt_tab')\n","\n","def extract_context_snippet(row, window=2, threshold=90):\n","    title = row['case_title']\n","    text = row['case_text']\n","\n","    if pd.isnull(text) or pd.isnull(title):\n","        return ''\n","\n","    sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)\n","    title_clean = title.lower()\n","\n","    for i, sent in enumerate(sentences):\n","        score = fuzz.partial_ratio(title_clean, sent.lower())\n","        if score >= threshold:\n","            start = max(i - window, 0)\n","            end = min(i + window + 1, len(sentences))\n","            return ' '.join(sentences[start:end])\n","\n","    return text"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"K2nxSMM-Dbxp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745156061027,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Наталия Федорова","userId":"07542168442705069017"}},"outputId":"2df000ff-c250-440e-92f3-c774e32eb9d1"},"id":"K2nxSMM-Dbxp","execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt_tab to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt_tab is already up-to-date!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data['context_snippet'] = data.apply(extract_context_snippet, axis=1)"],"metadata":{"id":"TFSXXPXxDlwa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745156073317,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":10044,"user":{"displayName":"Наталия Федорова","userId":"07542168442705069017"}}},"id":"TFSXXPXxDlwa","execution_count":34,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.sample(3)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":196},"id":"Y2RhTpnXKYhC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745156077223,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":98,"user":{"displayName":"Наталия Федорова","userId":"07542168442705069017"}},"outputId":"4d37ebf5-661e-48ab-d133-3e87ee82aa4f"},"id":"Y2RhTpnXKYhC","execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["         case_id case_outcome  \\\n","19735  Case19911        cited   \n","7557    Case7624        cited   \n","20339  Case20524        cited   \n","\n","                                              case_title  \\\n","19735  Baird Textiles Holdings Limited v Marks &amp; ...   \n","7557   Rahman v Secretary, Department of Education, E...   \n","20339   Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658   \n","\n","                                               case_text  title_in_text  \\\n","19735  The position is effectively captured in the fo...              1   \n","7557   4 November 2008, Cowdroy J delivered judgment ...              0   \n","20339  The principles governing the exercise of the C...              1   \n","\n","                                         context_snippet  \n","19735  The position is effectively captured in the fo...  \n","7557   4 November 2008, Cowdroy J delivered judgment ...  \n","20339  It is not necessary to restate, at length, his...

The first and second respondents were unsuccessful in respect of their notice of motion. However, for very different reasons, the parties have submitted that the usual rule as to costs should not be perfunctorily applied in relation to this notice of motion. In summary: The first and second respondents have submitted that: the parties' costs of the hearings on 8 December 2008 and 20 February 2009 be costs of the notice of motion; and because, of three clear issues identified in the notice of motion, Mrs Tracy was successful in relation to two, the first and second respondents should pay one-third of Mrs Tracy's costs on a party and party basis. Mrs Tracy has submitted that: there is no question that Mrs Tracy was wholly successful in the proceedings; in the circumstances, the costs ordered in favour of Mrs Tracy should be on an indemnity basis because: Mrs Tracy had to instruct solicitors and Counsel and thereby incur legal fees and disbursements, and if only party and party costs are awarded to Mrs Tracy she will be penalised by the difference between the party and party costs awarded and the amount of her own solicitor and client costs incurred in defending the proceedings; The first and second respondents engaged in inflammatory correspondence to the Court wrongfully claiming that the filing by Mrs Tracy of her written submissions on 9 February 2009 was not contemplated when they knew that those submissions were both contemplated, and ordered by the Court. The result of that conduct was that the Court convened a directions hearing, at which hearing it emerged that the objections made by the first and second respondents were groundless; The notice of motion was commenced or continued in disregard of known facts, including that the first and second respondents had evidence that Mrs Tracy had not provided any financial support for the principal action; The notice of motion was commenced or continued for an ulterior motive, presumably for the purpose of applying pressure to Mrs Tracy or her husband the second applicant as some form of intimidation or punishment. Mrs Tracy arranged time off work in order to comply with the requirement for cross-examination as notified by the first and second respondents, which the first and second respondents subsequently advised was not necessary; The notice of motion was commenced or maintained in disregard of clearly established law, including that the first and second respondents pressed for indemnity costs against Mrs Tracy notwithstanding that the applicants in the substantive proceedings had been the subject of an order for standard costs; The proceedings have been unduly prolonged by the making of groundless contentions by the first and second respondents; and The first and second respondents persistently breached the directions made by the Court in the proceedings and thereby caused Mrs Tracy to incur greater costs than she would have incurred had they complied with the directions of the Court. Consideration\",\n"," 'course, the usual rule is that costs follow the event in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order ( Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) ATPR 40-748 , Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 107). The first and second respondents were unsuccessful in respect of their notice of motion. However, for very different reasons, the parties have submitted that the usual rule as to costs should not be perfunctorily applied in relation to this notice of
